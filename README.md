 ### Contributing Guidelines
If you're able to write python (django) or JavaScript please contribute. It's a lot of work to write something like 
this properly from scratch. Please use best practices while contributing. This includes writing clean code (messy/hacky 
code will be rejected) and making sure it's well commented. Try to think of the next person who comes along so use 
variable names that make sense and avoid weird tricks that not everyone will understand.

**HSBNE members:** Check with Jaimyn (@jabelone) before working on something, then make a pull request when you are happy with your 
changes.

**Other people:** Work on existing issues (use comments to clarify/discuss things). If you want to fix undocumented 
bugs or add new things open an issue and ask how it should be done.
